# LiveryPlus Creation Guide

## Unity project Setup (same as the offical livery tool)

1. **Install Unity Hub**: [Unity Hub Download](https://unity.com/download)

2. **Install Unity 2022.3.6f1**: [Unity Editor 2022.3.6f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive)

3. **Download the Modified Unity Project** ZIP file

4. **Open Project**: Launch Unity Hub and open the downloaded project.

## Create an Assetbundle

1. **Import & Apply texture**:

	* Drag your livery texture into the project's `Assets` folder.
	* Double click on the `COIN_skin_matte_gray_b` prefab object, on the right you will find the inspector window with a MeshRenderer component.
	* In the Meshrender component, replace the `Materials` field with your own livery texture.
	* Scroll down a bit to find the Materials settings.
	* Add your texture to `Surface Inputs` -> `Base Map`
	* Edit the material any way you like 
		* To add emissions - enable the `Emission` checkbox, add your texture to `Emission Map`, and set the colour to white.
		* Fun stuff i've found include making it transparent or adding the texture to `Height Map` to make the texture move with the camera for a neat effect. you can probably do some real funky stuff with all the different fields


# !! _________________ !!IMPORTANT!! _________________ !!
** Rename the prefab to have the **exact** same name as the livery you're trying to update. the name is used as a key to find the correct ingame livery to overwrite.

3. **Assign AssetBundle**:

	* Select the prefab in the editor.
	* In the inspector (lower-right), under 'AssetBundle', click the dropdown and select `Newâ€¦`.
		(If you don't see it, it might be hidden, in the lower edge of the inspector window is a bar `Example ============`, click on it)
	* Name it something, preferably same to the livery name.
	* Only 1 prefab per bundle is allowed.

4. **Build & Export**:
	* Clear the folder `LiveryPlus/Assets/AssetBundles` or unity might not actually build or update it.
	* In Unity's top bar menu, click `liveryplus -> Build AssetBundle`.
	* Locate your file in the unity project folder: `LiveryPlus/Assets/AssetBundles/<yourliveryfilename>.liveryplus`

Your liverybundle file is now ready. Put it in the same folder as the bepinex mod `liveryplus.dll`
